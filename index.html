            <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
                high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very
                attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to
                connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and
                therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which
                encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library
                are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely
                distributed.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py)
                files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. <br>
                The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>

            <code><pre>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</pre></code>
            <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.<br>
                Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.</p>
            <code><pre>print("Hello, World!")</pre></code>
            <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your
                file, and run:</p>
            <code><pre>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</pre></code>
            <p>The output should read:</p>
            <code><pre>Hello, World!</pre></code>
            <p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.</p>

            <p>Creating Variables
                Variables are containers for storing data values. <br>
                Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. <br>
                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. <br>
                Example:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                x = 5 
                y = "John" 
                print(x)//5 
                print(y)//John 
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have
                been set.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Data_Types">
            <header>Python Data Types</header>
            <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.

                Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

                Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Text Type: str</li>
                <li>Numeric Types: int, float, complex</li>
                <li>Sequence Types: list, tuple, range</li>
                <li>Mapping Type: dict</li>
                <li>Set Types: set, frozenset</li>
                <li>Boolean Type: bool</li>
                <li>Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting the Data Type</h3>
            <p>You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Collections">
            <header>Python Collections</header>
            <p>There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
            <ul>
                <li>List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.</li>
                <li>Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.</li>
                <li>Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.</li>
                <li>Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right
                type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in
                efficiency or security.</p>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="List">
            <header>List</header>
            <p>A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.
                <br>
                Example <br>
                Create a List:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
                print(thislist)//['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']</pre>
            </code>
            <p>You access the list items by referring to the index number: <br>
                Example <br>
                Print the second item of the list:</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
                print(thislist[1])//banana</pre>
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Tuple">
            <header>Tuple</header>
            <p>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round
                brackets. <br>
                Example <br>
                Create a Tuple:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") 
                print(thistuple)//('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')</pre>
            </code>
            <p>You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets: <br>
                Example <br>
                Print the second item in the tuple:</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") 
                print(thistuple[1])//banana</pre>
                </code>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Set">
            <header>Set</header>
            <p>A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.
                <br>
                Example <br>
                Create a Set:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} 
                print(thisset)//{'apple', 'cherry', 'banana'}</pre>
            </code>
            <p>Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.</p>
            <p>You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index, since sets are unordered the items has no
                index. <br>
                But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a
                set, by using the in keyword.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Dictionary">
            <header>Dictionary</header>
            <p>A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are
                written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.<br>

                Example <br>
                Create and print a dictionary:</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                thisdict = { 
                "brand": "Ford",
                "model": "Mustang",
                "year": 1964 
              } 
              print(thisdict)//{'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}</pre>
            </code>
            <p>You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets: <br>

                Example <br>
                Get the value of the "model" key:</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                x = thisdict["model"]//Mustang</pre></code>
            <p>There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result: <br>

                Example <br>
                Get the value of the "model" key:</p>
            <code><pre>
                x = thisdict.get("model")//Mustang
            </pre></code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Conditions_and_If_statements">
            <header>Python Conditions and If statements</header>
            <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
            <ul>
                <li>Equals: a == b</li>
                <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
                <li>Less than: a < b</li>
                <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
                <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
                <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops. <br>

                An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword. <br>

                Example <br>
                If statement: <br>
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                a = 33 
                b = 200 
                if b > a: 
                  print("b is greater than a")//b is greater than a </pre>
                </code>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_While_Loops">
            <header>Python While Loops</header>
            <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
                <br>
                Example <br>
                Print i as long as i is less than 6:
            </p>
            <code>
                    <pre>
                    i = 1 
                        while i < 6: 
                            print(i)
                            i +=1      </pre>
                        </code>
            Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
            <br>
            <p>
                The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing
                variable, i, which
                we set to 1.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_For_Loops">
            <header>Python For Loops</header>
            <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or
                a string).

                This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method
                as found in
                other object-orientated programming languages.

                With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. <br>
                Example
                Print each fruit in a fruit list: </p>
            <code>
                    <pre>
                    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                    for x in fruits:
                    print(x)
                    </pre>
